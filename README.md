Vows Examples in CoffeeScript
=============================

I wrote this because I coudn't find it anywhere.

Running
-------

Compile:

    cake compile-coffee

Or better yet in one terminal tab just run and leave it there:

    cake watch-coffee

Then in another terminal tab (or screen):

    ☁  vowsjsexamples [master] ⚡ node test/division_by_zero.js 
    ··· 
    ✓ OK » 3 honored (0.006s)

And this one:

    ☁  vowsjsexamples [master] ⚡ vows test/the_good_things_test.js
    ···· 

    ✓ OK » 4 honored (0.001s)

And that's it... I'll add more examples (probably not from the website because I'm writing a full project with Vows and CoffeeScript.
